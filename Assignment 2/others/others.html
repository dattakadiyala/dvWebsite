<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Autonomous vehicles are still a developing technology; a large number of companies and researchers have speculated about future developments and the possible effects of the cars.<br>
<ul>
  <li>	2015, Tesla will introduce "Autopilot". This feature combines automatic lane change (after signal is applied), adaptive cruise control, and sign recognition to regulate speed and location. It's expected to be the first vehicle manufacturer to offer automatic lane change.</li>
  <li>	By the mid-2010s, Toyota plans to roll out near-autonomous vehicles dubbed Automated Highway Driving Assist with Lane Trace Control and Cooperative-adaptive Cruise Control.</li><li>	By 2016, Audi plans to market vehicles that can autonomously steer, accelerate and brake at lower speeds, such as in traffic jams.</li>
   <li>	By 2016, Mercedes plans to introduce "Autobahn Pilot" aka Highway Pilot, the system allow hands-free highway driving with autonomous overtaking of other vehicles.</li>
  <li>	By 2016, Mobileye expects to release hands-free driving technology for highways.</li>
  <li>	In 2016 (2017 model year), GM plans to offer a "super cruise" feature on select Cadillac models, with autonomous lane keeping, speed control, and brake control, so that parts of trips can be made without touching the wheel or pedals.</li>
  <li>	By early 2017, the US Department of Transportation hopes to publish a rule mandating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication by an as-yet unspecified deadline.</li>
  <li> GM says that by the 2017 model year, the Cadillac CTS will be V2V equipped.</li>
  <li>	By 2018, Mobileye expects autonomous capabilities for country roads and city traffic.</li>
  <li>	By 2018, Nissan anticipates to have a feature that can allow the vehicle manoeuver its way on multi-lane highways.</li>
  <li>	By 2020, Volvo envisages having cars in which passengers would be immune from injuries. Volvo also claim vehicles will effectively be "crash free." </li>
  <li>	By 2020, GM, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Nissan, BMW, Renault, Tesla and Google all expect to sell vehicles that can drive themselves at least part of the time.</li>
  <li>	2020, ABI Research forecasts that truly self-driving cars would become a reality by 2020 and that 10 million such new cars would be rolling out on to United States' public highways every year by 2032.</li>
  <li>	By 2020, Google autonomous car project head's goal to have all outstanding problems with the autonomous car be resolved.</li>
  <li>	By 2024, Jaguar expects to release an autonomous car.</li>
  <li>	By 2025, Daimler and Ford expect autonomous vehicles on the market. Ford predicts it will have the first mass-market autonomous vehicle.</li>
  <li>	By 2025, most new GM vehicles will have automated driving functions as well as vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology.</li>
  <li>	By 2035, IHS Automotive report says will be the year most self-driving vehicles will be operated completely independent from a human occupant’s control.</li>
  <li>	By 2035, Navigant Research forecasts that autonomous vehicles will gradually gain traction in the market over the coming two decades and by 2035, sales of autonomous vehicles will reach 95.4 million annually, representing 75% of all light-duty vehicle sales.</li>
  <li>	By 2040, expert members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) have estimated that up to 75% of all vehicles will be autonomous. </li>
