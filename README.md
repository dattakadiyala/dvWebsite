# dvWebsite
This website is developed and maintained in a DevOps model, forked to jenkins so, if you push a change to the git repo, you could directly see all the changes immediately  on the web, as jenkins puts the new data on the httpd server and the server will be restarted to apply all the changes.
Thank You for visiting this repo
