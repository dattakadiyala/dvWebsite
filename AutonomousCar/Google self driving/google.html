<p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; The Google Self-Driving Car is a project by Google that involves developing technology for autonomous cars, mainly electric cars. The software powering Google's cars is called Google Chauffeur. Lettering on the side of each car identifies it as a "self-driving car". The project is currently being led by Google engineer's of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory .A team at Stanford created the robotic vehicle Stanley which won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge and its US$2 million prize from the United States Department of Defense. </p><p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Legislation has been passed in four U.S. states and Washington, D.C. allowing driverless cars. The state of Nevada passed a law on June 29, 2011, permitting the operation of autonomous cars in Nevada, after Google had been lobbying in that state for robotic car laws. &nbsp;Google presented a new prototype of their driverless car that had neither a steering wheel nor pedals. On December 22, 2014, Google unveiled a fully functioning prototype of their driverless car and planned to test it on San Francisco Bay Area roads beginning in 2015.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Google Self-Driving Car Project - Google Plus 2.jpg" width="780" height="380"></p>
